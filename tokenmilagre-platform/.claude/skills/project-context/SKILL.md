# Project Context Skill

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This skill must be loaded at the start of every conversation to understand project guidelines and critical rules.

---

## üìö Load Project Memory

When this skill is invoked, read the following file to load all essential project context:

**File**: `/home/destakar/Trabalho/CLAUDE-MEMORY.md`

This file contains:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical interaction rules (ALWAYS ask before executing)
- üìö Documentation structure (CLAUDE-MEMORY.md, LOG.md, sugest√µes.md)
- üéØ Project philosophy and values
- üö´ What to avoid
- üìû Official links
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Git rules
- üìù Update history

---

## üéØ After Loading

Once you've read CLAUDE-MEMORY.md, you'll know:

1. **How to interact with the user** - The absolute rule: ALWAYS ask before executing code
2. **Documentation structure** - When to consult LOG.md and sugest√µes.md
3. **Project values** - Minimalism, accessibility, open source, education, security
4. **Critical Git rules** - Only commit files inside tokenmilagre-platform/
5. **What to avoid** - Design and code anti-patterns

---

## üöÄ Auto-Start Development Server

**IMPORTANT**: After loading CLAUDE-MEMORY.md, automatically check and start the development server.

### Check if Server is Running

```bash
# Check for Next.js dev server on port 3000
lsof -i :3000 -t > /dev/null 2>&1 || echo "NOT_RUNNING"
```

### If Server is NOT Running

**Automatically execute** (without asking, as per user request):

```bash
npm run dev > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

**Then inform the user**:
```
‚úÖ Servidor de desenvolvimento iniciado automaticamente
üåê http://localhost:3000
```

### If Server IS Running

**Silently skip** (no need to inform the user)

### Exception to "Always Ask" Rule

This is an **explicit exception** to the "ALWAYS ask before executing" rule because:
1. User explicitly requested this automation
2. Starting dev server is non-destructive
3. Improves workflow efficiency
4. Equivalent to "Rode o servidor" command (immediate execution)

## üìñ Instructions for Claude

When this skill is invoked:

1. Read `/home/destakar/Trabalho/CLAUDE-MEMORY.md` completely
2. **Check and auto-start development server** (see section above)
   - Check if port 3000 is in use
   - If not, start `npm run dev` in background
   - Inform user if server was started
3. Acknowledge that you've loaded the project context
4. Be ready to follow all critical rules, especially:
   - ALWAYS ask before executing code (except auto-start server)
   - NEVER commit files outside tokenmilagre-platform/
   - Use Prisma directly in Server Components (no HTTP fetch)
5. Consult LOG.md when historical context is needed
6. Consult sugest√µes.md before suggesting improvements
